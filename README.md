T&L Node Console
================
This is a website for displaying measurements from T&L nodes. The
measurements are obtained from a MQTT broker and/or a database.

See the [Sensor Nodes](http://sensornodeinfo.rockingdlabs.com/) site for
more details.

At this point only the Gauges page is functional.

Installation
------------
On a system with Apache2 installed:
  * Copy the `TLnodeConsole.conf` file to the `sites-available/`
    directory.
  * Adjust the values in the `sites-available/TLnodeConsole.conf` to
    match your environment.
  * Copy the `html/js/mqttConfig.js_template` to `html/js/mqttConfig.js`
  * Adjust settings in `html/js/mqttConfig.js` to match your MQTT
    configuration.
  * Enable the web site:

        $ sudo a2ensite TLnodeConsole.conf

  * You can test the web site without a MQTT broker or TLnodes by
    uncommenting the test code in `html/js/gauges.js`
